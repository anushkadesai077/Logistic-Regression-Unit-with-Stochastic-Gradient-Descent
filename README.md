# Logistic-Regression-Unit-with-Stochastic-Gradient-Descent

Implemening a basic Single-Neuron Neural Network (the Logistic Regression unit). Carrying out Stochastic Gradient Descent for optimization using the Log Loss function. 

For the activation function sigmoid is used followed by comparison with using ReLU.

Next, performing regularization using the Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) methods. Again, comparisons are done between the two.

All model performance is evaluated using the accuracy and the F1 score.
